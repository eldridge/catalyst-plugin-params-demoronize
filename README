Catalyst::Plugin::Params::Demoronize is a Catalyst plugin
that will convert non-ISO extended ASCII characters commonly
utilized by various Microsoft products into standard ASCII.
Additionally, it will also convert the unicode equivalents
of these characters into standard ASCII if so configured.

Inimitable mistakes cleaned up by this plugin include those
dastardly "smartquotes" (read: dumbquotes) utilized by none
other than Microsoft Office.
